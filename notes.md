# Second match

Auton hit the middle bar and turned weird, so was crossing into opponents zone
at end of auton. Out of battery.

# Third match

Will hit goalpost if set up too far right.

# Other ideas

- We can vibrate the controller (`controller.rumble(".-.")`). Maybe every 10
  seconds?
- We can draw on the controller's LCD (`controller.lcd.print("xyz")`).
